# vulkan-hello-world
This is my simple vulkan hello world project which simply draws a triangle using the vulkan api. A trickier task than you would at first expect.
I followed the wonderful https://vulkan-tutorial.com. Full credits to the author of the tutorial.

As a note, I chose to write my code in pure C whearas the tutorial uses C++. I chose to do this for a few reasons: I wanted to learn C, I enjoyed the challenge of having
to manage my own code infastructure, it stopped me from being able to copy-paste the tutorials code when I got stuck and hence forced me to debug my own code,
and finally it gave me a greater sense of accomplishment as it felt more like my own code that simply copied.
